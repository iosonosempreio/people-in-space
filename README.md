# People in Space. Now.

Just a first experiment with the incredible <a href="https://p5js.org">p5js</a> library.

The application connects with a [service](https://peopleinspace.herokuapp.com/) that provides real-time information of the astronauts that are on some galactic mission in this precise moment and plot them as floating coloured circles scattered across the space of the window.
